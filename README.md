this repo implements a way to evolve a certain class of algorithms.

initially I had the idea of evolving a solver for A^{1/2}x = b, although I am a bit stuck with it. But I had some luck with optimizers.

Since I am experimenting with this still it will be updated will better readme if it works.

Here is an example notebook where I evolved a linear system solver https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cRGP485LLryW5DzX_jn9Mb8woBw_VRIw?usp=sharing
