this repo implements a way to evolve a certain class of algorithms.

initially I had the idea of evolving a linear solver for A^{1/2}x = b but I am stuck with it, however I had better luck with optimizers, now I shall install and run this on google colab and kaggle.

Since I am experimenting with this still it will be updated will better readme if it works.
